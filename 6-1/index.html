     <h3><a id="oughttobe">There Ought to Be a Law</a></h3>
     <!-- Only keep the 4 most recent items here.  After that move to --
  -- ~/public_html/there-ought-to-be-a-law.html -->

<ul>

  <li>
    There is a <a href="http://web-old.archive.org/web/20180409163324/https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-blockchain-fifo-dirty-coins/">threat to wipe out bitcoin</a>, and all cryptocurrencies, using a
    strained legal excuse.  The threat is to confiscate individual
    bitcoins if those specific coins were used previously in some illegal
    transaction, or passed through a broker that was later accused of any
    sort of crime.
    <p>
      The article describes two alternative plans for choosing who to punish
      in this way, but the effect would be the same: to punish ordinary
      users of bitcoins effectively at random.  Ostensibly it is not random,
      but rather based on a criterion that ordinary users couldn't hope to
      check, so it's effectively equivalent to punishment at random.
    <p>
      It is fundamentally unjust to subject people to punishment at random.
      Constitutions ought to insist that no one can be punished, or legally
      discriminated against, or have property seized, based on circumstances
      not feasible for them to have recognized and avoided.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    A global requirement to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/public-registries-shell-panama-papers">list the ultimate beneficial owner</a> of
    every company would put a big crimp in global corruption.
    <p>
      Even if many small countries do not adopt this requirement, large
      countries could effectively make it compulsory by denying the tax
      deduction as a business expense for payments to companies whose
      ultimate beneficial owner is not registered.
  </li>

  <li>
    We need a law requiring the immigration agency to publish all
    its data
    about a particular person's interrogation or exclusion, if that person
    publicly asks.  We must not allow the agency to hide its refusal to
    explain itself to the victim behind a facade of concern for the
    victim's own privacy.
  </li>

  <li>
    To treat a payment to a foreign company as a tax-deductable
    business expense, that company should have to disclose its
    true owners, and whatever other information is needed to
    prevent tax dodging.
  </li>

</ul>

Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK,
the Philippines.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national

ID card</a>.

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="http://lifelongactivist.com">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
